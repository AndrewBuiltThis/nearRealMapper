# Monitor Your Field Assets Simply

### You've probably been told at one point or another that you need a NoSQL database for live data. 

### You've been lied to by THE MAN.

Most organizations don't really, really need real live data. Really.

This application provides one-minute incremental data updates for data stored in a traditional RDMS (in this case, Oracle). 

I'll post more information in a bit -- I have to head to a meeting and then out for drinks with my buddy.

Feel free to reach out for help or question!

Cheers,
A
